# Project Log 2
I managed to get a scene working by running it on Jordan's computer. I'm not sure why it isn't working on Livingston's 
computer. Either way I have got a scene and pushed to the git. I need to add a submodule to the AML project on git which 
will let everyone else have access to it as well. 

To have an extension run at startup you add it to the [kit file](../apps/omni.isaac.sim.base.kit) which is the config 
for when isaac launches from the [startup file](../isaac-sim.sh). This will cause it to autoload. I believe the extension has to be enabled from the extensions menu window.
