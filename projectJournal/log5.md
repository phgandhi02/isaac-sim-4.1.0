# Project Log 5

I managed to get the simulator to create a second viewport window and render the outputs to the window. This lets me have a perspective view of the robot where I can see the entire scene and I also have a rendered view that shows what the robot camera sees. I am thinking about implementing a GUI element that would let me switch the camera view that I want to see on the second viewport since they should all be the same resolution. The main constraint is that I can't switch between different resolution cameras on the same viewport. Additionally, I have to be careful about the resolution of the viewport because running two 4k viewports is too taxing on this computer. I moved the resolution down to 1080p and that helped a great deal. I should be able to easily export the footage to ROS2 using a node that is placed manually or via scripting. I can also setup articulation actions which is fairly easy so now I should be able to implement a controller as a higher level controller to feed articulation actions to the robot joint states.
