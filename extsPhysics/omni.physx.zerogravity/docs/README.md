## About

This extension uses NVIDIA PhysX to provide user-guided physically accurate placement of assets in a USD stage.
It introduces a new "Zero Gravity" toolbar button which enables the feature.
When you enable the "Zero Gravity" mode, assets with static or dynamic markers will simulate collisions.

## Quick Start

1. Enable the "Zero Gravity" from the toolbar or press the 'X' key to toggle on/off.
2. Set static and dynamic markers on selected assets with the action bar buttons.
3. Move and Rotate selected assets with simulated collisions.
4. Drop selected assets with the action bar drop button or holding the 'END' key.
5. Drag an asset with the SHIFT key + mouse-drag over the asset with the cursor.
6. If you want automatic markup of objects near selection, activate the Sweep Mode
