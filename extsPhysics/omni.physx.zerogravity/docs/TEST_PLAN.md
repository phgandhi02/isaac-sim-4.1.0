# Physics Zero Gravity - Test Plan

## Tests (tests.py)
- Test extension can be enabled / disabled 
- Test geometry can have placement markers none,static and dynamic and have or not have appropriate associative rigid bodies applied.
- Test marked geometry can be dropped.
TODO:
- Test transformation deltas can be handled via physics
- Test dynamic geometry is stopped by other static geometry.
- Test dynamic geometry moves other dynamic geometry.
- Test clear markers do not get changed by dynamic geometry
- Test you can clear all geometry
- Test existing physics is used for zero gravity markers
- Test a sphysics scene simulates properly after zero gravity mode is enabled and disabled.
