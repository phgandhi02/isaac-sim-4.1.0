"""
This scenario takes in a robot Articulation and makes it move through its joint DOFs.
Additionally, it adds a cuboid prim to the stage that moves in a circle around the robot.

The particular framework under which this scenario operates should not be taken as a direct
recomendation to the user about how to structure their code.  In the simple example put together
in this template, this particular structure served to improve code readability and separate
the logic that runs the example from the UI design.
