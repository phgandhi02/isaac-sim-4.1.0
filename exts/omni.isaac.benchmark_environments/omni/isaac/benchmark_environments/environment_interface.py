"""
Environments have a set of Objects in them that can move or change over time.
The default environment doesn't have any objects in it.

Subclasses of Environment implement 
    build_environment: instantiate all objects/targets in the environment according to **kwargs
    update: called every frame, update moves all moving elements of the environment and does any necessary maintainence
    get_new_scenario: return a series of targets that the robot should follow

Environments have random seeds to ensure repeatability.  This means that all randomness in the environment should
    be achieved through numpy's random module.

As a convention, environments are displaced from the robot along the positive x axis, and mostly centered about the y axis.
    Some robots (such as the UR10) may need the environment to be rotated about the robot.  The UR10's environment config file
    rotates each environment by pi/2 about the z axis.
