class DifferentialController(BaseController):
    """


    This controller uses a unicycle model of a differential drive. The Controller consumes a command in the form of a linear and angular velocity, and then computes the circular arc that satisfies this command given the distance between the wheels.  This can then be used to compute the necessary angular velocities of the joints that will propell the midpoint between the wheels along the curve. The conversion is

        .. math::

            \omega_R = \\frac{1}{2r}(2V + \omega b) \n
            \omega_L = \\frac{1}{2r}(2V - \omega b)

    where :math:`\omega` is the desired angular velocity, :math:`V` is the desired linear velocity, :math:`r` is the radius of the wheels, and :math:`b` is the distance between them.


    Args:
        name (str): [description]
        wheel_radius (float): Radius of left and right wheels in cms
        wheel_base (float): Distance between left and right wheels in cms

        max_angular_speed (float): OPTIONAL: limits the maximum angular speed that will be produced by the controller. Defaults to 1E20.
