Before running this script, enable the robot_benchmark extension in the Isaac Sim UI under "Window->Extensions".
Open "Robot Benchmark" from the toolbar and take a look at the drop-down menu.  You will be able to select different robots
and controllers written for those robots.  Take note of what is already there.

Then, come back to this example, and set RUN_EXAMPLE=True.  This will add options to the drop-down menu.  It will create a clone of the
Franka robot under the name "Example Robot" that floats .1 m above the ground.
It will also create a controller for any Franka robot under the name "Example Controller".
This example_controller will be registered under our "Example Robot" Franka clone, and under the "Franka" robot that already appears in
the drop-down menu.  The "Franka" robot will have this new controller added to its pre-existing list of supported controllers, and the
"Example Robot" will have this controller as its only available controller.

----------------------------

Scrolling down, you will see that this python file is written as a script inside an "if RUN_EXAMPLE==True" block.  This script is always
run on the startup of the robot_benchmark extension because it is listed as a python module in "extension.toml".

The same goes for the empty folder "robot_benchmark/user".
The user should place register any new robots or controllers in the "robot_benchmark/user" folder by copying the structure found in this template 

-----------------------------

Note that there is further explanation at the bottom of this script that is meant to be read after reading through the script.

"""
You may be wondering a few things about this example script:

What is a RobotLoader, and why is it necessary?
    A RobotLoader exists so that you can register a robot without initializing it until the correct moment.
    Isaac Sim has a few annoying properties around Articulations.  When you load an Articulation, it gets added to 
    the USD stage.  You have to do this BEFORE pressing "play".  But if you try to initialize the Articulation with 
    Articulation.initialize() (which is necessary to control the robot), it will fail with confusing errors unless "play"
    has already been pressed.  
    
    By filling in a BaseBenchmarkRobotLoader interface, the robot_benchmark extension takes care of timing these things 
    appropriately.  Additionally, you can write many robot_loaders, but only the robot_loader that is selected in the 
    drop-down menu will actually place a robot on the stage.  

Why is the controller registered the way it is? 
    The controller is registered with a function to be called later because, once again, the timing needs to be correct to
    have everything get initialized without errors.  In robot_benchmark.py, the controller load_function is called
    after the robot Articulation has been initialized.  This structure allows for multiple controllers to be written for a robot,
    but only one controller will ever be initialized at a time.
    
    When writing a load_function for a controller, you may take in kwargs that you supply to the register_controller() function.
    These kwargs are stored internally to be passed along later when the load function is called.  
    
    Notice in the example_controller_load_fun that one kwarg was the robot_loader object.  
    The RMPFlow controller requires an initialized robot Articulation object to function.  It would fail if,
    instead of passing the robot_loader as a kwarg, we passed an argument "robot_articulation = robot_loader.get_robot_articulation()".
    This is because at the time this script is run, robot_loader.get_robot_articulation() returns None because the robot 
    has not been loaded yet.  But, by the time that robot_benchmark.py calls the controller_load_function, the robot Articulation
    will have been initialized.

What do you mean when you mention logs in robot_benchmark.py?
    When robot_benchmark is initialized, it can be set to log data to a json file.  This is pointless when running it from the UI, but
    there is a provided standalone script for running the (environment,robot,policy) pairs of your choice with data logging.  See the 
    top of the standalone_benchmark_runner.py script for a more detailed explanation.
