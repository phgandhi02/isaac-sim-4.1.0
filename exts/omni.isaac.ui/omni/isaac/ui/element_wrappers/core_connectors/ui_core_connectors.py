    Create a special type of UI button that connects to the omni.isaac.core.World to enable convenient "Load" functionality.
    The World acts as a scene manager that simplifies user interaction with the simulator.
    This provides the user with certain guarantees at the time that their callback functions are
    called.

    The setup_scene_fn() is called with the guarantee that a World has been created.  In this function,
    the user is meant to add the asssets they want to the USD stage.  These assets then must also be added to
    the World. World is a singleton class.  And example setup_scene_fn implementation would include:

        - world = World.instance() # Get the unique instance of the World
        - world.scene.add(usd_object) # Add the user-loaded usd object to the scene

    The setup_post_load() function is called with the gurantees that the World has been created, the
    setup_scene_fn() has already been called, all objects that the user added to the World have been properly
    initialized, and the timeline is paused at timestep 0.

    Args:
        label (str): Short descriptive text to the left of the LoadButton
        text (str): Text on the LoadButton
        tooltip (str, optional): Text to appear when the mouse hovers over the LoadButton. Defaults to "".

            to the World. This function should take 0 arguments.  The return value will not be used.
