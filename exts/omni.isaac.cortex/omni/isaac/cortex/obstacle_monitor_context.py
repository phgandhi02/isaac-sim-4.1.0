""" These classes make it easy to monitor obstacles and automatically suppress and unsuppress them
as needed.

Obstacle monitors use the logical state monitoring framework to handle this functionality in the
background. This module provides an ObstacleMonitorContext base class to make adding obstacle
monitors tooling straightforward.

Example usage (adapted from standalone_examples/api/omni.isaac.cortex/behaviors/ur10/bin_stacking_behavior.py):

        # The specifics aren't important. See bin_stacking_behavior.py for the exact implementation.
        ...
        return is_required

        # This monitor will enable and disable three obstacles related to navigation, each of which
        # are stored in the world object.
