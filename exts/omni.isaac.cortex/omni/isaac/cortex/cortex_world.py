""" The CortexWorld extends from the core API's world object and adds the behavior portion of the
Cortex processing pipeline.

The full Cortex processing pipeline includes:
1. Perception
2.*World modeling
3.*Logical state monitoring
4.*Behavior (decisions)
5.*Command processing (policies)
6. Control

The stared steps are included in the CortexWorld. World modeling is handled by the standard scene
representation APIs of the underlying World, and CortexWorld provides APIs for adding logical state
monitors, behaviors, and commandable robots which supply their own command APIs for supported
policies. It also provides an API for directly adding a decider network, which includes its own
logical state monitors which are automatically added.

Currently the CortexWorld only supports the standalone python app workflow.

Example usage:
    simulation_app = SimulationApp({"headless": False})
    from omni.isaac.cortex.robot import add_franka_to_stage
    from omni.isaac.cortex.cortex_world import CortexWorld

    world = CortexWorld()
    world.scene.add_default_ground_plane()

    robot = world.add_robot(add_franka_to_stage(name="franka", prim_path="/World/Franka"))

    # ...
    # Create your decider_network using the tools from df.py and dfb.py, or load it using:
    #
    # from omni.isaac.cortex.cortex_utils import load_behavior_module
    # decider_network = load_behavior_module(module_path).make_decider_network(robot)
    # ...

    world.add_decider_network(decider_network)

    world.run(simulation_app)
    simulation_app.close()
