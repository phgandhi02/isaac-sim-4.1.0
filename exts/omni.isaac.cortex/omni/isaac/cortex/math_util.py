    """Measures the distance between the provided transforms.

    Generally translation and rotational distances are not composable into a unique distance metric
    since transform distance between two geometric objects in a scene is really a function of the
    geometry of the objects (e.g. distance between surface points) rather than an object-independent
    function of translation and rotation.

    However, a reasonable proxy is to measure the simple Euclidean distance between the position
    components and rotation matrices. Those two components won't be comparable, but they can be
    weighed together into a good metric.

    Note that a rotation matrix is defined by placing the frame's (normalized) axes into the columns
    of a matrix. Specifically, if the frame is defined by {o, ax, ay, az}, where o is the origin
    (position) and a{x,y,z} are the three 3D axes, the rotation matrix is R = [ax, ay, az].
    Therefore, the Euclidean distance between two rotation matrices R1 and R2 is simply the distance
    between end-points of the axes of the two frames extending from a common origin.

    Equation:

      dist = position_scalar * |o1 - o2| + rotation_matrix_scalar * |R1 - R2|

        T1, T2: The transforms to be compared. These should both be 4x4 homogeneous transform matrices.
