""" The decision framework. Decider networks and state machines are implemented here.

Conceptually, a decider network is a mapping from world and logical state to a choice of high-level
action. That mapping often has intuitive structure to it; decider networks make it easy to design
many of these mappings by hand. The world and logical state is stored in a user defined context
object which is simply passed around within the framework and made available to the decider nodes
and state machines to aid in making decisions and taking action.

A decider network is an acyclic graph of decider nodes, each of which has a simple enter(),
decide(), and exit() interface. The decide() method makes the decision by choosing a child. In a
leaf, that child can be None, in which case, the node typically acts to step an action. Leaves, for
that reason, often represent actions. See DfDecider, DfDecision, and DfAction. DfNetwork is a good
entry point for reading through the code. It shows how the decider network is created and stepped.

The basic descent algorithm for tracing from the root of the decider network down to an action
choice is implemented by df_descend(), which is run once every cycle. Importantly, when the system
reaches a given DfDecider node for the first time along a given decision path through the network,
it calls enter() on that node, followed by decide(). While it continues to trace the same path from
the root to the node, it calls only decide() on that node. But once that node is no longer reached,
it calls exit() on the node. This is implemented by keeping track of the path traced through the
network from cycle to cycle and observing whether the new path trace is branching relative to the
previous. When a branch is detected, exit() is called on the old branch in reverse order from the
old leaf to one node before the branch point (the first node no longer reached), and enter is called
on all new nodes along the new path to the new leaf. See df_descend() for details.

These calls to enter() and exit() give the decider nodes a notion of statefulness allowing them to
setup and tear down local memory to affect their decisions. The methods parallel the API to state
machines (see DfState), which have the API enter(), step(), and exit(). That means state machines
can be used inside decider nodes to help make decisions. Likewise, decider networks can be used
inside state machines to help define the state behavior.

The decider network is fundamentally reactive. It's constantly making decisions from the root to the
choice of action leaf on each cycle, and will change its mind as needed if the world or logical
state changes. But sometimes it's important to be able to lock the decider network to prevent it
from changing its mind at critical points (especially for atomic actions implemented as chain state
machines). Setting the decider's is_locked attribute will lock the path from the root to that
decider node and prevent the descent algorithm from deviating from it. See DfSetLockState for a
useful tool for locking and unlocking decider nodes.

Note that this reactivity contrasts fundamentally from state machines where reactivity is usually
implemented as a set of event trigger designed over the top of an unreactive state machine. In state
machines, the system is unreactive by default, and reactivity is the exception. In decider networks,
the system is reactive by default, and locking the system is the exception. This focus on reactivity
makes decider networks ideal for designing reactive collaborative robotic systems.

A collection of useful classes/methods:

DfNetwork, df_descend, DfDecider, DfDecision DfAction form the basic implementation of decider
networks. DfHsmAction uses a hierarchical state machine to define an action.

DfState is the basic interface for a state machine. DfState is bindable (derives from DfBindable) in
the same way DfDeciders are, so when used in decider networks, they have access to the context and
params in the same way decider nodes do (see also DfDecider). DfStateSequence is a simple chain
state machine that's easy to construct from individual states which execute and ultimately return
None when done. Likewise, a DfHierarchicalState abstracts a hierarchical state of a hierarchical
state machine. The run_state_machine() method takes a state and runs it until its step() method
returns None.

DfDeciderState is a state machine that internally runs a decider network inside its step method,
never exiting.  Likewise, a DfTimedDeciderState is a decider state which as a time limit. Once that
time limit has passed, it exits. DfWaitState is a simple state that just waits for a prespecified
duration.

DfStateMachineDecider is a DfDecider node which internally has a state machine which is stepped
during each decide() call.

DfSetLockState locks or unlocks the decider path to accommodate temporally extended atomic actions.
And DfWriteContextState provides a way to write into the context when the state is entered.

The DfRldsDecider is an important DfDecider type implementing the Robust Logical Dynamical Systems
model of reactive decision making.

    Important: Deriving classes that override __init__() should call super().__init__() on the first
    line. It performs important base class initialization.

    Derived classes should override enter(), decide() and exit() as needed. decide() should make the
    decision (using the internal context and passed parameters to do so) and return a DfDecision()
    object encapsulating its choice.

    See the comments in the API methods enter(), decide() and exit() for details on when these
    methods are called and how to use them. The descriptions make use of the concept of a decision
    session. A decision session for a given decider node is an unbroken sequence of decider network
    steps where each step traces the same path from root to the decider node. enter() is called at
    the beginning of the session, and exit() is called when the session ends as indicated by a
    change in path. decide() is called at every step of a session (after enter() on the first step).

    Example: Consider a trace A->B->C->D from root A to leaf D. The first time down, enter and
    decide() (in that order) is called on each node encountered. As long as the same path A->B->C->D
    is traced, only decide() is called on each of those nodes, and we consider each of those nodes
    to be in session. But once the trace becomes, say, A->B->E->F, the nodes A and B are still in
    session, but C and D aren't. We call exit() on D then C (in that order) because they're exiting
    their session, and call enter() on E and F (in that order) as they're encountered during the
    descent, just before calling their decide(), because they're entering a new session.

    Note, in that example, if the path changes from A->B->E->D, the same algorithm is run. The
    prefix path from A->B->E leading into D is different from what it used to be, so the session has
    changed. We call exit() on D and E (in that order), and call enter() right before decide() on E
    and D as we reach them.

    The RLDS decision algorithm starts every cycle at the end of the chain and traces up toward the
    beginning checking each node's IsEnterable condition. It chooses the first node it encounters
    whose IsEnterable condition returns true. That node is considered active, so on the next cycle
    it does the same, but checks instead this node's IsRunnable condition.

    Intuitively, the goal of each node's associated policy (which amounts to the ultimate choice of
    action it makes in the decider network under it) is to push the system toward triggering the
    IsEnterable condition of the next node in the chain. These systems are fundamentally reactive
    and if ever a more distal node becomes enterable for any reason, it immediately transitions to
    it.

    See the Robust Logical Dynamical Systems paper for an in-depth description of these systems:

        Representing Robot Task Plans as Robust Logical-Dynamical Systems
        Chris Paxton, Nathan Ratliff, Clemens Eppner, Dieter Fox
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01896

    The theory proves conditions under which this system is guaranteed to push this purely reactive
    system toward a goal condition.

    The RLDS decider node implements this algorithm as a sequence of child decider nodes, ordered in
    order of increasing priority, each of which are DfRldsNode objects with is_runnable() and
    is_enterable() methods. A call to decide() steps from the highest priority node to the lowest,
    checking is_enterable() on each (or is_runnable() if it's already running the decision), and
    simply chooses the first that returns true.

    Note that distal nodes handling necessary preconditions can be tacked on as higher-priority
    nodes beyond the goal in the chain. For instance, a chain that needs the gripper to be open can
    do this so if it finds the gripper to be closed it'll always automatically be triggered. These
    ideas are discussed in the paper, although the paper was a pre-cursor to decider networks, and
    with the more general decider networks it's often easier to implement those preconditions using
    a different decision hierarchy, including by adding them as decorator nodes of sort over the top
    of the DfRldsDecider.
