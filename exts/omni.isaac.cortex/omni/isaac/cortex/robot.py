""" This module provides the base classes for representing robots and building their command APIs by
adding commanders.

The Cortex collaborative systems functional pipeline includes:
1. perception: sensor data --> entities and transforms
2. world model: entities and transforms --> USD
3. logical state monitoring: USD --> logical state
4. decisions: USD and logical state --> commands
5. command API: commands --> articulation actions
6. control: articulation --> actions to movement

This module implements the command API layer translating higher level commands produced by the
decision layer to the commanders that process them into lower-level control commands. Commanders
wrap policies and define the command API used to modulate the underlying policies' behavior. 

Operationally, the commanders are added to CortexRobot objects and made available to state machines
and decider networks (decision layer) through the context object. Two examples of commanders are the
MotionCommander (see motion_commander.py) and the GripperCommander (see below). A decider node might
access them via

class MyAction(DfAction):
    def step(self):
        self.context.robot.arm.send_end_effector(target_pose)
        self.context.robot.gripper.close()

Here, self.context.robot is an instance of CortexRobot which has arm and gripper members
containing, respectively, a MotionCommander and a GripperCommander. The API of those commander
objects are directly callable from decider nodes and state objects.

The CortexRobot base class provides an add_commander(name, commander) method which will add the
commander and create an attribute with the provided name. So CortexRobot objects can be used
directly to wrap a loaded USD robot prim on the stage and add custom commanders to it. The APIs of
those commanders then become the command API available to the decision layer. Alternatively, we
provide some base classes with built in common commanders such as MotionCommandedRobot and derive
some robot-specific cortex robot classes with full collections of relevant commanders, such as
CortexFranka and CortexUr10.

See also:
- commander.py for the Commander base class interface.
- motion_commander.py and GripperCommander (below) for example commanders.
- standalone_examples/api/omni.isaac.cortex for complete examples.

class CortexGripper(Commander):
    """Base class for a commander representing a parallel gripper. Creates a command API mimicking
    standard parallel gripper commands.

    The two main commands are:
    1. Move-to: Servo the gripper to a specified width at a specified speed.
    2. Close-to-grasp: Close the gripper until a defined force is felt.

    These can be implemented by a general command which takes width, speed, and force parameters,
    with speed and force being optional. This class provides both a general API for these commands,
    and semantic commands such as open(), close(), move_to(), and close_to_grasp().

    On construction, an articulation subset is given which defines which joints are controlled by
    this commander. The specific mapping from the width generalized coordinate to the joint angles
    (and back) are robot specific and need to be defined by the deriving class by overriding the
    abstract methods joints_to_width(joint_positions) and width_to_joints(width).

    Note that command state is stored in the underlying Articulation which is reset separately from
    the commanders, so this commander doesn't explicitly need to override reset().
