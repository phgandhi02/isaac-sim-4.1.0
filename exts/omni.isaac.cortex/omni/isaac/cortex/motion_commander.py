""" This module provides a motion commander that wraps a motion policy to give it a standard
flexible command interface.

The command, defined by the MotionCommand class, allows users to specify not only a target pose, but
additionally information describing how the robot's end-effector should approach that target and how
the system should handle null space resolution (arm posture).

Fundamentally, a robotic system's state includes both position and velocity so specifying both a
target pose and the direction from which it should approach is both more natural and more complete.
Often this information is provided implicitly by scripting a little state machine that sends the
end-effector through an intermediate standoff pose before heading to the target. But the motion
commander makes the information a core part of the command so users don't have to rely as much on
way points.

    funnel approaching the target from a particular direction.

    The approach direction is a 3D vector pointing in the direction of approach. It's magnitude
    defines the max offset from the position target the intermediate approach target will be shifted
    by. The std dev defines the length scale a radial basis (Gaussian) weight function that defines
    what fraction of the shift we take. The radial basis function is defined on the orthogonal
    distance to the line defined by the target and the direction vector.

    Intuitively, the normalized vector direction of the direction vector defines which direction to
    approach from, and it's magnitude defines how far back we want the end effector to come in from.
    The std dev defines how tighly the end-effector approaches along that line. Small std dev is
    tight around that approach line, large std dev is looser. A good value is often between 1 and 3
    cm (values of .01-.03 in meters).
