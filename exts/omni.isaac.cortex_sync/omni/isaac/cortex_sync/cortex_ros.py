""" Cortex sync tools using ROS as the communication backend.

For a simple example usage, see

    standalone_examples/api/omni.isaac.cortex/example_cortex_sync_main.py

The main differences between this standalone python app and a standard Cortex standalone python app
are the creation of these objects:

    cortex_sim = CortexSimRobotRos(sim_robot)
    cortex_sim_objects_ros = CortexSimObjectsRos(sim_objects)
    cortex_control = CortexControlRos(robot)
    cortex_objects_ros = CortexObjectsRos(cortex_objects, auto_sync_objects=args.auto_sync_objects)

These objects register PhysX callbacks and handle all communication processing in the background. 

The breakdown is:
1. We collect up the sim objects into a sim_objects dict and pass it into a CortexSimRobotRos object
   which handles publishing ground truth poses from those objects.
2. We wrap belief objects as CortexObject(obj) and add it to a cortex_objects dict. That dict of
   relevant objects is passed into a CortexObjectsRos object which handles receiving those poses and
   making them available through the CortexObject objects as the measured poses.
3. We create a CortexSimRobotRos object to handle mimicking the ROS interface from the physical
   robot. It publishes joint state information for the robot.
4. We make a CortexControlRos object which handles synchronizing the belief robot with the sim (or
   physical) robot as well as publishing joint-level commands to external controllers.

        Gripper commands [String]: /cortex/gripper/command

    Note that often the gripper commands will come directly from the CortexControlRos object while
    the arm's joint commands will come from an separate controller node emulating the real time
    controller for controlling the physical robot. A simulated version of that controller can be run
    using the command:

        rosrun cortex_control sim_controller

    This class also handles publishing joint state objects for each commander's articulation subset
    on the topic:

        Joint state messages [JointState] /robot/joint_state

    Each commander's subset is published as a separate message (which is common for physical robots).

    Args:
        robot: The robot object with commanders mimicking the physical robot's command interface.
