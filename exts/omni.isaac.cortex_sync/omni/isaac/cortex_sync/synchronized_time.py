    """Represents the online updated synchronized time information resulting from the command-ack
    protocol when communicating with off-board controllers (see cortex_control for details).

    The main issue is two fold:
    1. The cortex system may be running at slower than real-time (< 60hz) if processing gets bogged
       down. In that case, we still want to maintain consistent effective motion policy integration
       that matches the real-world wall-clock time. Reactivity in those cases might slow, but the
       behavior overall will remain the same speed. (To the cortex system it'll seem like the world
       is moving fast, and it'll adjust the way it integrates accordingly.)
    2. Even when maintaining real-time integration on the cortex machine, the cortex machine's clock
       might progress at a slightly different rate overall than a robot's internal microcontroller's
       clock. This was observed when controlling the Franka early on -- the real-time clock would
       run slightly fast so that over a number of hours the evaluation point of the incrementally
       generated splines would eventually overrun the spline interpolation buffer. The command-ack
       synchronization protocol automatically estimates that clock offset over time to eliminate
       this drift.

    The synchronized time is returned as a CycleTime object. Issue 1 is addressed by the CycleTime's
    period field (representing an exponentially weighted average of the measured cycle time), and
    Issue 2 is addressed by the CycleTime's time field (giving the corrected wall-clock time using
    the estimated corrections from the command-ack protocol).

    Args:
        skip_cycles: The number of cycles to skip before processing the messages. Early messages
            timings can be off if the loop runner isn't running at rate up front.
