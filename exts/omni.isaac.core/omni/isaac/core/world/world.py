class World(SimulationContext):
    """This class inherits from SimulationContext which provides the following.

    SimulationContext provide functions that take care of many time-related events such as
    perform a physics or a render step for instance. Adding/ removing callback functions that
    gets triggered with certain events such as a physics step, timeline event
    (pause or play..etc), stage open/ close..etc.

    It also includes an instance of PhysicsContext which takes care of many physics related
    settings such as setting physics dt, solver type..etc.

    In addition to what is provided from SimulationContext, this class allows the user to add a
    task to the world and it contains a scene object.

    To control the default reset state of different objects easily, the object could be added to
    a Scene. Besides this, the object is bound to a short keyword that facilitates objects retrievals,
    like in a dict.
