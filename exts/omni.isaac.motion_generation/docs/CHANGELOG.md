### Removed
- Deprecated omni.isaac.dofbot and removed its usage.

## [7.0.2] - 2024-06-12

## [3.3.0] - 2022-07-18

### Changed

- Updated ArticulationSubset to wait until robot joint states are queried to access the Articulation object.  This avoids annoying errors when attempting to initialize an ArticulationMotionPolicy before the "play" button has been pressed.

## [3.2.1] - 2022-06-28

- Added RmpFlowSmoothed to lula/motion_policies.py to support cortex.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-04-18

### Changed

- Extracted methods from MotionPolicy to form a WorldInterface class.  This has no functional effect on any code outside MotionGeneration

## [1.2.0] - 2022-04-15

### Changed

- Obstacles are now marked as static explicitly when added to MotionPolicy

## [1.1.0] - 2022-04-14

## [1.0.2] - 2022-04-01

### Changed

- modified default RmpFlow configs have fewer updates per frame (10 was unnecessary) and to not ignore robot state updates by default
- updated golden values in tests as a direct result of config change

## [1.0.1] - 2022-04-01

### Added

- test case for motion_generation extension: test for proper behavior when add/enable/disable/remove objects to RmpFlow

### Fixed

- ground plane handling: enable/disable/remove ground_plane didn't work
- static obstacle handling: dictionary key error when enable/disable/remove static obstacles

## [1.0.0] - 2022-03-25

### Changed

- Restructured MotionGeneration extension to place emphasis on MotionPolicy over MotionGeneration.  The user is now expected to interact directly with a MotionPolicy for adding/editing obstacles, and setting targets.  MotionGeneration is a light utility class for interfacing the simulated USD robot to the MotionPolicy (get USD robot state and appropriately map the joint indeces).  
- RmpFlowController -> MotionPolicyController: 
    - The RmpFlowController wrapper that was used to interface Core examples with RmpFlow has been expanded to wrap any MotionPolicy
- omni.isaac.motion_generation/policy_configs -> omni.isaac.motion_generation/motion_policy_configs: changed folder containing config files for MotionPolicies to be named "motion_policy_configs" to leave room for future interfaces to have config directories
- Path to RmpFlow: omni.isaac.motion_generation.LulaMotionPolicies.RmpFlow -> omni.isaac.motion_generation.lula.motion_policies.RmpFlow

### Added

- interface_config_loader: a set of helper functions for checking what config files exist directly in the motion_generation extension and loading the configs as keyword arguments to the appropriate class e.g. RmpFlow(**loaded_config_dict)

## [0.2.1] - 2022-02-15

- Updated internal RMPflow implementation to allow for visualizing Lula collision spheres as prims on the stage

## [0.1.3] - 2021-12-13

### Changed

- Removed deprecated fields from the Lula robot description files and RMPflow configuration files for the DOFBOT and Franka robots.  This also corrects an oversight in the Franka robot description file that had resulted in a lack of collision spheres (and thus obstacle avoidance) for panda_link6.

## [0.1.2] - 2021-12-02

### Changed

- event_velocities to events_dt in PickPlaceController
- Added new phase of wait in PickPlaceController
